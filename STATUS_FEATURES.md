# Status Features Implementation

This document describes the status/story features that have been implemented in the Pastel Chat Blossom UI application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Status Uploading
- Users can upload photos and videos as status updates
- Supported formats: Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) and Videos (MP4, WebM, etc.)
- Status uploads are stored in Firebase Storage and metadata in Realtime Database
- Statuses automatically expire after 24 hours

### 2. Status Viewing with Invitation-Based Privacy
- **Privacy Control**: Statuses are only visible to users who have accepted chat invitations
- Users can only see statuses from:
  - Users whose invitations they have accepted
  - Users who have accepted their invitations
  - Their own statuses
- This ensures that statuses are only shared with trusted contacts

### 3. Status Viewer
- Full-screen status viewer with navigation
- Support for both images and videos
- Progress indicators showing multiple statuses
- User information display (name, avatar, timestamp)
- Smooth navigation between statuses

### 4. Status Deletion
- Users can delete their own statuses
- Deletion removes both the media file from storage and metadata from database
- Automatic UI updates when statuses are deleted

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
```
status/
  {userId}/
    {statusId}/
      mediaURL: string
      userId: string
      timestamp: number
      type: 'image' | 'video'
```

### Key Components

1. **StatusUploadDialog** (`src/components/home/StatusUploadDialog.tsx`)
   - Handles file selection and upload
   - Preview functionality
   - Error handling and validation

2. **StatusList** (`src/components/home/StatusList.tsx`)
   - Displays statuses filtered by accepted invitations
   - Groups statuses by user
   - Handles status viewing and deletion

3. **StatusViewer** (`src/components/home/StatusViewer.tsx`)
   - Full-screen status viewing experience
   - Navigation between statuses
   - Delete functionality for own statuses

4. **Firebase Functions** (`src/lib/firebase.ts`)
   - `fetchStatusesForAcceptedContacts()`: Filters statuses by invitation status
   - `deleteStatus()`: Handles status deletion from both storage and database
   - `getUserInfo()`: Fetches user information for display

### Privacy Implementation

The privacy system works by:
1. Fetching all invitations (sent and received) for the current user
2. Creating a set of user IDs with accepted invitations
3. Only fetching statuses from users in this accepted contacts set
4. Including the current user's own statuses

This ensures that statuses are only visible to users who have established a chat relationship through the invitation system.

1. Navigate to the Status tab
2. Click the floating action button (+)
